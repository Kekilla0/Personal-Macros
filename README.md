# Kekilla's Personal Macros

These are a compilation of my own personal macros. If you intend on copying them for any offical capacity, please cite them.

Old macros from this respository are stored in [Old Macros]](https://github.com/Kekilla0/Personal-Macros/tree/OLD)

# Support

These are _personal_ macros, I will accept Issues and Pull Requests but do not expect expediant fixing. I keep these mostly for snippet usage and to teach others the wonderful world of FVTT macros.
